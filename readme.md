# Ubuntu docker with NXWitness VMS Client

I had trouble running the NXWitness VMS client on my Fedora system.
Therefore I created docker image that allows using it on other systems
than Ubuntu or Windows.

# To Build the image:
```bash
./build_image.sh
```

# To Run the client in docker:
- Image will be automatically pulled
```bash
./run_client.sh
```
